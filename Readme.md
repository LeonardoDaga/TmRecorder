# TmRecorder

TmRecorder is a tool for Trophy Manager. I started developing it in 2010, as far as I can remember, and it has been developed during this years with many changes and utilities that have been added and removed (you can find traces of them in the commits history).
Being developed in 2010, the technology under the app is quite old (.NET Framework 4.5.2, Windows Form Application), and the way the team and players data is managed can be improved a lot. 
Moreover, to make TmRecorder with programming technologies available now (.NET Core, for example) and so making it available for other platform it should be almost completeley rewritten.
I simply don't have time to make these changes, that's why I am making this code available for all.
I will anyway add some maintenance for bugs and little improvements, that will be published as soon as I will publish the updated application.
All the contribution will be appreciated.

About the published code, I know, it's a mess. 
It's mainly composed by a main project with the application (the TmRecorder project) while the rest of the code is structured into code libraries. 
There is also the BloomCalculator project that is a spinoff from an existing internal application.
